     <h2>Hi there,<br> My name is <span>Tobey</span></h2>

    <section id="about">
        <h1 class="title"><span>About me</span></h1>
        <p>i am a self taught back end web developer who is currently studying to get a degree in Medical Laboratory Science at a private <br>university in Lagos, Nigeria. After which i plan on furthering my programming knowledge by going into Software engineering. <br> Although i am cureently lacking in experience because i am still in the beginner phase of my journey, i am definetely not lacki- <br>ing in knowldege, skills and the technical know hows</p>
        <p class="second">Some of the technologies ive been working with:</p>
        <div class="listing">
        <ul class="pt-1">
            <li>Html</li>
            <li>Css</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            </ul>
        <ul class="pt-2">
            <li>React Js</li>
            <li>C#</li>
            <li>Python</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <p>Other Than Programming, i'm interested in the developments of technologies. And i also play a lot of videogames.</p>

    <section id="experience">
        <h1 class="title"><span>working Experience</span></h1>
        <p>Although i don't have any working experience, at the moment due to the fact that im just starting out on my web design and software engineering journey due to the fact that the market isn't as merciful to us designers that are just starting out without experience, i have applied for multiple internships to gain working experience, but those internships require working experience. I have also applied for freelancer gigs on sites such as fiverr and the likes, but no one is open to the idea of amateurs to handle their projects. I do hope that in the nearest future i am able to update my website portfolio by being able to finally add my work experiences.</p>
